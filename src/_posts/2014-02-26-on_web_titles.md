title: On Web Industry Titles
---

Roles and responsibilites have become highly specialized, and the amalgamations of titles have only served to confuse and discourage recruiters and applicants alike. I see a lot of interesting posts about interviewing "front-end developers" and "UI engineers", as well as the experiences of the interviewees themselves. There are also a lot of articles debating what the title should be based on the role and the skills needed to perform a job function. I don't know what it is about these roles that holds such status in every industry, but there is a common thread in ours that is disheartening: none of these titles use the word "web" anymore. We're all so busy trying to impress each other and pad our résumés that we're missing the most critical flaw in how we label ourselves.  

How many times have you had to "dumb down" your title to explain it to a friend or relative? Do you see the problem here? I guarantee it's almost always "web designer" or "web developer". Those titles are the ones we should be using. Think they're too ambiguous to apply to your unicorn status? Use both.  

Why the distinction? There are people who are what I consider to be "technical designers"—those who have a solid foundation in interaction, user experience and user interface design—and "design-conscious developers"—those who got their starts hacking on server middleware and databases, but care about things like percieved performance, modularity, API design, and developer UX.  

If I were to tell my family that I'm a "UI Dev", they'd just blink at me. Those 2 terms have no relevance to anyone outside the software industry. Even if they did, generalities are abound, even though the title seems specific at face-value. Think about it:  

<p><em>“Dev”?</em> OK, developer, I guess.</p>
<p>But <em>“UI"</em>? Interface, OK. But which interface? Where? iOS? Servers? Cars? ATMs? </p>
</blockquote>

It seems title one-upsmanship has caused us to lose site of the fact that design is a communication domain. If we can't communicate what we do every single day that we get paid a salary for, then we've failed.  

So, I suggest we go with titles that both industry and non-industry folks can know what we do for a living.  

<dl>
<dt>Web prototyper</dt>
<dd>This person's focus is on translating wireframes and product concepts (possibly their own) into Web-based prototypes. Is that it? Yes, that's it. Code is not production-ready. Instead, it's used to convey concepts and garner buy-in from clients and stakeholders.</dd>

<dt>Web UI developer</dt>
<dd>This person's focus is on the technical aspects of Web code. Code is production-ready, browser-tested, performance tested, and user-facing.</dd>

<dt>Web application developer</dt>
<dd>This person's focus is on building scalable, reliable, business logic  software, and secure, flexible data storage/retreival systems. Code is only focused on the user in regards to how easily data is stored, sorted, and retrieved. In this case the user can mean both the end user on the "client side" and the developer consuming the APIs.</dd>

Notice some missing terms? 'Browser'? Specific references to languages? The terms "architect", "engineer", or "designer"? Any mentions of which "end" I'm referring to? Allow me to explain the absence of each.

I think the easiest way to get away from thinking of [the browser as a singular entity](http://adactio.com/journal/6692/) is to stop using it entirely, and replace it with "Web". The [Web is everywhere](http://adactio.com/journal/1716/), and isn't just on mobile, tablet, or screen. That's like talking about "the car" or "the home". Sure, there's a basic component makeup, but very rarely are two identical.

JavaScript, CSS, HTML, are the common languages of the Web world. They're the Chinese, Spanish, and English of ours. They are the original Model-View-Controller. It's nearly impossible to have one without at least one of the other 2. When you start putting specific technologies in your title (PHP, Java, Flash, C++) you're not only selling yourself short, but you're now speaking a very-specific and time-sensitive dialect that only a handful of like-minded people will be able to appreciate. You're also [typecasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting) yourself, which is bad for your long-term career.

With all due respect, the terms “architect” and “engineer” seem to have been borrowed to impress others within our industry, or maybe to give a sense of prestige to those outside of it. An architect still designs and creates large-scale physical structures, and the term engineer, while [technically applicable](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering) still feels like a title steroid, and only conveys complexity (at least to me).  

The “ends" are a relatively new model, segregating front end and back end developers into client and server side camps. Go ahead, tell your buddy you're a "front end engineer" and I guarantee you, that person will immediately think of a train conductor. The "front end" of what? See how silly this is sounding without the context of the Web?  

The modern Web developer role is erasing the lines between front-end and “middleware")[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting) really, thanks to Rails, Node.js and build automation/deployment tools like Grunt and Rake. We work on the Web. Some have [made suggestions](http://theothersideofcode.com/renaming-backend-frontend-to-application-ui-developers) for renaming "front-end developer/engineer" to "UI Developer", which is a good start, but I'd like to see the word “Web” in there. 

Tell me what you think.
