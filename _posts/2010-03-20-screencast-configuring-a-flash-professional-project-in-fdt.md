title: Screencast&#58; Configuring a Flash Professional Project in FDT
---

<p>Well, I had some free time, with all of the missing <a title="Flash Camp Boston" href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/free-flash-camp-in-boston-announced">Flash Camp Boston</a> I'm doing, so I thought I'd put together a screencast demonstrating how to set up FDT and Flash Professional. This is my first <em>ever </em>screencast, so, forgive the <em>"uh"</em>s, <em>"umm"</em>s, and any tangential rambling. I'm planning on doing a lot of screencasts in the future,<del datetime="2010-04-08T02:56:22+00:00"> so I'm testing out different software. So, until I figure out what software and screen resolution I want to use, I'm resorting to hacking Jing's embed code. If the video below isn't big enough (and it probably isn't), hit <a title="Kevin Suttle on Vimeo" href="http://vimeo.com/10756820">this link </a>to see the full <strong><em>[Ed. note: Probably too big]</em></strong> version.</del> <strong>Update: </strong>I've obtained a license for <a title="Telestream - ScreenFlow" href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a> (thanks to my boss), and will be using it to do screencasts from now on. I ran over my Screencast.com bandwidth limit, which is actually a <em>very</em> good thing, all thanks to you! The only bad news is that I had to record the SWF in ScreenFlow (yes, because I was too lazy to try to convert it or re-record it), but the good news is that there are no bandwidth issues and it's much more manageable in WordPress now.
