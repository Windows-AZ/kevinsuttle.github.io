title: Follow-up poll&#58; Which IDE do you use to create Flash content?
---

<p>After the tremendous response from my <a title="Found and Lost: The Flash IDE" href="http://kevinsuttle.com/2009/05/02/found-and-lost-the-flash-ide/">previous post</a>, I was wondering if it was a good idea to create a poll to see exactly how people are developing their Flash content. As luck would have it, shortly thereafter @RichTreolta was pinging the <a title="Twitter- Rich Treolta" href="http://twitter.com/richtretola/statuses/1846624356">Twittersphere</a> to get feedback on ideas for new <a title="InsideRIA" href="http://insideria.com/index.htm">InsideRIA</a> polls. So, I submitted my idea and it was chosen! Rich has <a title="InsideRIA poll" href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/new-poll-what-ide-do-you-use-t.html">posted a poll</a> on InsideRIA to get a feel for how the community chooses to create Flash content. <!--more--> Let everyone know which IDE you <em>primarily* </em>use to create Flash content!  *(No multiple selections as it is now.)  <a title="InsideRIA poll" href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/new-poll-what-ide-do-you-use-t.html">http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/new-poll-what-ide-do-you-use-t.html</a> <strong>Update: </strong><a title="InsideRIA poll results" href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/poll-results-which-ide-do-you.html">The poll</a> is now closed with a rather paltry 369 votes. I must say I'm a little disappointed that more people didn't participate, but that doesn't mean the results are without substance. The clear favorite was Flex Builder 3, with nearly 42% reporting it as their Flash IDE of choice. I really can't say I'm surprised. However the most interesting tidbit was which program was in the 2nd place slot. <a title="FlashDevelop - Main Page" href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Main_Page">FlashDevelop</a> came in with almost 18% of the votes, and while I have definitely heard of it, I myself have not taken the time to see why so many developers enjoy working in it. I'll set aside some time soon to give it a test drive and report my results here. In the meantime, you can see the InsideRIA poll findings <a title="InsideRIA Poll Results" href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/05/poll-results-which-ide-do-you.html">here</a>. Thanks again to <a title="Rich Trelota - EverythingFlex" href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/">Rich Treolta</a> for picking my poll idea!</p>
