I wrote an article for UX Magazine about the magnetism for aesthetics, and how beauty can be functional. 

<blockquote><p>The literal connotation of ”multiscreen” would be ”many screens.” Sure it’s catchy, and sounds great on marketing materials, but it’s far from accurate. Though the idea of “write once, deploy everywhere” is enticing to developers and project managers alike, should that be the goal? Granted, productivity is paramount and time is money, but simply resizing the same application to fit on multiple devices doesn’t necessarily ensure the best experience for users.</p>
