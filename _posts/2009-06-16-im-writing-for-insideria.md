title: I'm Writing for Inside RIA
---

I've been offered an opportunity to write for <a title="O'Reilly Media" href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>'s <a title="InsideRIA - Home Page" href="http://insideria.com/index.htm">InsideRIA</a>! Obviously I will still post here on Commented Out [Ed Note: I actually have several posts in the works - stay tuned] but it's nice to have a more established name on the page I'm writing on. :) My first post is entitled "<a title="InsideRIA - My first post" href="http://www.insideria.com/2009/06/ux-discussion-skyfire-mobile-b.html">SkyFire Mobile Browser 1.0 and the Flash User Experience.</a>" Be sure to check it out and give me some feedback!
