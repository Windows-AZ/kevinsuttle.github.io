title: Poll&#58; What would your ideal timeline&frasl;motion editor be in Flash Professional?
---

<p>I know it's been awhile, and trust me, a <em>ton </em>of blog posts are coming, but I just want to see something for myself. All I want to know is what YOU, the day-in, day-out, Flasher want the timeline in Flash to look like.  <strong>This is in no way sponsored by Adobe, </strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">this is strictly to satisfy <em>my own</em> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">curiosity</span> </strong>and see what the Flash community wants. I've been working in Flash for years, and have also been asking for the After Effects timeline/motion editor for just as long. Humor me and let me know what you ALL think.  What do YOU want? Let's hear it! <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Spread this far and wide!  <em>Just a reminder, if you vote 'Other', please explain in the comments! Thanks! - KS</em></span></p>
